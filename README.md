# Addressbook

This is a sample address book application developed on the Eclipse RCP 3.4 platform.
I develop it for my [upcoming German book about Eclipse RCP](http://www.ralfebert.de/rcpbuch/) and my [Eclipse RCP training courses](http://www.ralfebert.de/seminare/rcp/). I also use it to experiment with features of the Eclipse RCP platform.
Currently everything is very simple and not suitable for real-world usage. My plan is to enhance it to the point where one would want to use this application to manage real contacts.

This is what it looks like at the moment:
