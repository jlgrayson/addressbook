# Address Book

`com.example.addressbook` is an example application for the Eclipse RCP 3.5 platform:

I'm working on it for my [upcoming German book about Eclipse RCP](http://www.ralfebert.de/rcpbuch/) and my [Eclipse RCP training courses](http://www.ralfebert.de/seminare/rcp/).

The branch `simple` only uses Eclipse RCP, so its only dependency is the feature `org.eclipse.rcp` (Eclipse RCP). It is structured in a very simple fashion and only utilizes basic features of the Eclipse RCP platform.

The application is developed and tested on OpenJDK 6 and Eclipse RCP 3.5.

## Running the application

* Set up a new target for Eclipse RCP development containing only the `Eclipse RCP SDK` feature from the latest Galileo release site.
* Clone or download a copy of the application and import the projects into Eclipse using `File > Import > Existing projects into workspace`.
* Launch `addressbook.product` in `com.example.addressbook`.
