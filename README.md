# Addressbook

This is a sample address book application developed on the Eclipse RCP 3.4 platform.
I develop it for my Eclipse RCP training courses and to experiment with features of the Eclipse RCP platform.
Currently everything is very simple and not usable for purposes other than software development. My plan is to enhance it to the point where one could use this application to manage real contacts.
