# Addressbook

This is a sample address book application developed on the Eclipse RCP 3.4 platform.
I develop it for my Eclipse RCP training courses and to experiment with features of the Eclipse RCP platform.
Currently everything is very simple and not usable for real-world usage. My plan is to enhance it to the point where one would want to use this application to manage real contacts.
